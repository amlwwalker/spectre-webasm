# Heros

Heros are large banners generally displayed at the top of a page

You can find the original Spectre [documentation here](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/layout/hero.html)

There are two types of hero straight out of the box

## Standard Hero

```go
components.Hero("Spectre (wasm)", "Using the Spectre css library in wasm with Go!")
```

## Media Hero

```go
components.MediaHero("Spectre (wasm)", "Using the Spectre css library in wasm with Go!", "cbB3QEwWMlA"),
```
